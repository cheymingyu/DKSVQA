["The rider is leaning in order to maintain balance and control on the motorcycle while cornering. Leaning helps the rider to shift their weight to the outside of the turn, allowing them to make sharper turns and reduce the risk of skidding or losing control.", "The rider is leaning to counterbalance the motorcycle and reduce the centrifugal force of the turn. This helps the rider maintain control of the motorcycle and keep it upright."]
