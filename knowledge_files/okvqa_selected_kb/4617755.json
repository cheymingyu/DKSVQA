["Cats are mammals, not reptiles. Mammals are endothermic (warm-blooded) animals which have hair or fur and produce milk for their young. Reptiles are ectothermic (cold-blooded) animals which have scales and lay eggs.", "The cat has fur, which is a characteristic of mammals and not reptiles. Additionally, reptiles do not have white paws or a white chest, which the cat in the image does."]
