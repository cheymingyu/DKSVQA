["Refrigeration is the process of keeping things cold by removing heat from them. Refrigeration is achieved by using a refrigerant, a substance that absorbs heat from the environment and releases it elsewhere. Common refrigerants include ammonia, carbon dioxide, and Freon.", "A refrigerator is an appliance that helps keep food and drinks cold by circulating cool air inside its insulated walls."]
