["Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium with a different index of refraction. This causes the light to bend, and the different wavelengths of light bend at different angles, creating a spectrum of colors.", "Light refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, such as air, water, or glass, and is bent due to the change in speed. This bending causes the light to split into its component colors, creating a rainbow effect."]
