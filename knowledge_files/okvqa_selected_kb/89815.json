["Waves are generated by wind as it blows across the surface of the sea. The size of waves generated depends on the strength of the wind, the length of time the wind has blown in the same direction and the distance over which the wind has blown.", "Ocean waves are surface waves that occur on the free surface of bodies of water."]
