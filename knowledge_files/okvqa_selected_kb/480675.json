["Wind turbines are devices that convert the kinetic energy of the wind into electrical energy. They consist of a rotor, blades, a generator, and a tower. The blades capture the wind's energy and convert it into rotational energy, which is then used to generate electricity.", "Wind turbines are machines that convert the kinetic energy of wind into electrical energy. They are composed of three blades mounted on a tower and connected to a generator. The blades spin in the wind and turn a shaft, which spins a generator to produce electricity."]
