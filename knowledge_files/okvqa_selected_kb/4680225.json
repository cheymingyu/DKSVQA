["To prepare the cake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. In a large bowl, mix together the butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until creamy. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Spread the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool before frosting.", "Pound cake is typically prepared by creaming together butter and sugar, then adding eggs and flour. Once the batter is mixed, it is poured into a pan and baked. The cake is then topped with a layer of frosting."]
