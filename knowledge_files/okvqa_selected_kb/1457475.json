["The buoyancy of the boats keeps them afloat. The buoyancy is generated by the displacement of water by the hull of the boat, which causes an upward force that counters the weight of the boat and its contents.", "The boats are kept from sinking by a combination of their buoyancy and the airtight compartments inside the hull."]
