["Motorcycles are not recommended for children to ride as they require a high level of skill and coordination to operate safely. Furthermore, children may not have the physical strength or cognitive ability to safely operate a motorcycle.", "Motorcycles are not suitable for children to ride by themselves due to their size, power, and lack of safety features."]
