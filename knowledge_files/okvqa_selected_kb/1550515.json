["The Moon's gravitational pull causes the ocean's tides, which helps to shape coastlines and move sediment around the world. The Moon's gravitational pull also affects the Earth's atmosphere, which can cause strong winds and storms.", "The Moon's gravitational pull causes two bulges in the Earth's oceans, one on the side closest to the Moon, and one on the side furthest from the Moon. This phenomenon is known as the 'tidal effect' and it causes the ocean to rise and fall twice per day."]
