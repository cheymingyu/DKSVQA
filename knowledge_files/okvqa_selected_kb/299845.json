["It is difficult to tell from the photo whether the body of water is a salt water beach or a lake. However, if the beach chairs are located in front of an ocean, then it is likely a salt water beach.", "The type of beach can be determined by the type of water it is located near. If it is located near a body of salt water, such as an ocean or sea, then it is a salt water beach. If it is located near a body of fresh water, such as a lake or river, then it is a fresh water beach."]
