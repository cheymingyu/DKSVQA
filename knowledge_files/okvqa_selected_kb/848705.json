["The clouds seen in the sky are cirrus clouds, which are thin, wispy clouds composed of ice crystals. They often form at high altitudes (over 20,000 feet) and are often seen in the shape of mares' tails or feathers.", "The clouds in the image appear to be cumulus clouds, which are fluffy, white, rounded tops and flat bases."]
