["A microwave oven is an electric oven that heats and cooks food by exposing it to electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequency range.", "A microwave oven is a kitchen appliance that heats food by bombarding it with electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequency range. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating."]
