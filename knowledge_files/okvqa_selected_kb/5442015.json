["The most common way to tie a tie is to start with the wide end of the tie on the right side and cross it over the narrow end. Then, bring the wide end around the back of the narrow end and up through the loop. Finally, bring the wide end around the front of the knot and tuck it into the loop.", "The four-in-hand knot is a simple and easy-to-learn knot that produces a symmetrical and neatly-tied knot."]
