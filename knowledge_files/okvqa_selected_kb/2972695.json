["A microwave oven is a kitchen appliance that heats food by bombarding it with electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequency range. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating.", "A microwave oven heats food by passing microwave radiation through it. As microwaves pass through food, they cause the water molecules to vibrate, producing heat."]
