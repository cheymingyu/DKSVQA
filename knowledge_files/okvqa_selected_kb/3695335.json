["The clouds in the sky are likely caused by a weather phenomenon known as \"sunset clouds,\" which are typically formed when warm air from the ground rises and meets cooler air in the atmosphere. This type of weather can occur in any season, but is most common in the summer months.", "The clouds in the image are most likely formed when warm air rises and cools off, causing the water vapor in the air to condense and form clouds."]
