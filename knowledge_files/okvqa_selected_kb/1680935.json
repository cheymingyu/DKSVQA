["The water is making a wave, which is a moving ridge or swell on the surface of a body of water, typically caused by the wind.", "The shape of the wave is determined by the shape of the seafloor. The wave is usually an arching shape, called a crest, which is created by the energy of the wave pushing the water up."]
