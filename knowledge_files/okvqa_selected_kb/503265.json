["Kites were invented in China, where materials ideal for kite building were readily available: silk fabric for sail material; fine, high-tensile-strength silk for flying line; and resilient bamboo for a strong, lightweight framework.", "Kite flying is an ancient sport that is enjoyed by people of all ages. The first kite was flown in China more than 3,000 years ago."]
