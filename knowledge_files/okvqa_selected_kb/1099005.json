["This is most likely a desert, as deserts typically have dry, orange ground and red dirt, and they are often found in areas with little vegetation. Beaches, on the other hand, are typically found near bodies of water and have white sand and blue water.", "Deserts are areas of land that receive very little precipitation, generally less than 250 mm (10 in) annually. Beaches are areas where sand, gravel, or other sediment is deposited by the sea or other body of water."]
