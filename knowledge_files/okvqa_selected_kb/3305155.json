["It is difficult to determine the handedness of the athlete based on the picture alone. However, the body position of the athlete and the direction of the swing may provide clues as to whether the athlete is right-handed or left-handed.", "The athlete's dominant hand is determined by the arm with which he is swinging the bat. If the athlete is swinging the bat with his right arm, he is right-handed. If he is swinging the bat with his left arm, he is left-handed."]
