["The toilet is often referred to as the loo in British culture.", "In British English, the term \"loo\" refers to a toilet, and is a shortening of the earlier \"Waterloo\" (water closet), which itself derives from the French \"gardez l'eau\" (keep the water), a warning to close the toilet lid before flushing, to avoid spraying water outside the bowl."]
