["Aircraft typically fly at altitudes of between 30,000 and 40,000 feet. This altitude affords the aircraft the most efficient flight patterns, as well as the ability to fly above most weather patterns.", "The highest altitude ever reached by a commercial aircraft is 71,000 feet by a Boeing 747-8F freighter operated by Cargolux."]
