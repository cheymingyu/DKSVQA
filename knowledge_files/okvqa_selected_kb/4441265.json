["The ocean's water levels are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun, as well as the rotation of the Earth. This causes the ocean to rise and fall in a regular cycle known as the tides.", "The gravitational pull of the moon causes the ocean to bulge in the direction of the moon, creating high tides. The gravitational pull of the sun causes the ocean to bulge away from the sun, creating low tides."]
